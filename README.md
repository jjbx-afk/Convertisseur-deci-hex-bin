# deci-hex-bin Converter 

This is one of my first apprenticeship projects.
I created a Google Sheets tool that converts numbers between :

- Decimal → Binary & Hexadecimal
- Binary → Decimal & Hexadecimal
- Hexadecimal → Decimal & Binary

I did all the conversions manually by working out the logic myself.
Google Sheets was only used to organize the data, not to calculate it for me.
